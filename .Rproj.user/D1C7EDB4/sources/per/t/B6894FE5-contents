## Analysis of Civilian Complaint Review Board Data, Published by ProPublica.

ProPublica used a FOIA request to acquire this data, detailing nearly 12,000 complaints against approximately 4,000 New York Police Department (NYPD) officers. According to Data is Plural, the data was collected by the Civilian Complaint Review Board which was created after a change in a New York law overturned the shielding of records of instances of excessive force from public view. The data includes descriptive statistics regarding the identities of both the officers and those filing complaints. After a year when systemic racism in policing has received increased scrutiny, I wanted to examine this data and see if there was evidence of racial discrimination. One factor that is important to note before delving into the data is the racial and ethnic breakdown of New York City. The most important thing to note is that according to 2019 Census data Whites make up the largest majority of the city's population. As we see in this first graph.
## Population Breakdown


```{r graph1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

nycensus%>%filter(Race!="N/A",Percentage!="N/A)")%>%ggplot(aes(x=Race,y=Percentage,fill=Race))+geom_col()+theme_minimal(base_size = 12)+ylab("Percentage of Population")+xlab("Race and Ethnicity")+ggtitle("Racial Demographics of New York City")+labs(subtitle = "New York Census Data",fill ="Race and Ethnicity")+labs(color="Race and Ethnicity")+scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")


```






As shown in the first figure, White people make up the majority of New York City's population. With this in mind I then started by filtering the data for use of force complaints. I did this because of the immense amount of public debate which seems to be centered around use of force, in particular, the chokehold and the use of firearms. Then because men appear more frequently in the data as complainants than women, I separated the two groups for clarity.

```{r graph 1, echo= FALSE }

Force%>%filter(year_received>="2000",catracegender!="NA",catgender=="Male")%>%group_by(catracegender)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year_received,color=catracegender))+geom_line(stat="count")+
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)+ylab("Number of Complaints")+xlab("Year Complaint was Received")+ggtitle("Yearly Use of Force Complaints by Race and Ethnicity")+labs(color="Race and Ethnicity")+scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")

```


## Men

The first graph looks at the amount of complaints received each year. It shows that there are many more use of force complaints from Black men then by any other racial or ethnic group. Immediately we see Black men are overrepresented in the data given their share of New York City's population. Meanwhile White men seem to be underrepresented. While the number of complaints is trending downward in 2019, this is due to both the Coronavirus Pandemic and a plan to overhaul the complaint system rather than any change in policing behavior.


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

Force%>%filter(year_received>="2000",catracegender!="NA",catgender=="Female")%>%group_by(catracegender)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year_received,color=catracegender))+geom_line(stat="count")+
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)+ylab("Number of Complaints")+xlab("Year Complaint was Received")+ggtitle("Yearly Use of Force Complaints by Race and Ethnicity")+labs(color="Race and Ethnicity")+scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
